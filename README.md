# Machine Learning Labs from Stanford University
This repository contains my completed labs from Stanford University's Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification course, of the Machine Learning specialization

Topics covered:
- Supervised and Unsupervised Learning 
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Descent

More specifically, the files cover the following: <br>
•	Implement and visualize a cost function <br>
•	Implement gradient descent <br>
•	Optimize a regression model using gradient descent <br>
•	Use vectorization to implement multiple linear regression <br>
•	Use feature scaling, feature engineering, and polynomial regression to improve model training <br>
•	Implement linear regression  <br>
•	Use logistic regression for binary classification <br>
•	Implement logistic regression for binary classification <br>
•	Address overfitting using regularization, to improve model performance <br>
